# Change Requests

> **Instructions for the LLM:** When processing this file, implement each outstanding change request in order. For each one:
> 1. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous — do not assume.
> 2. Check `design/references/` for any supporting context (images, logs, screenshots) mentioned in the request.
> 3. Check `design/assets/` for any app files (images, fonts, static files) that need to be integrated into the project. Always keep the originals in `design/assets/`.
> 4. Implement the code changes in `src/`.
> 5. Update `design/prd.md` to reflect the change.
> 6. Move the completed request from **Outstanding** to **Finalized** below.
> 7. Update `README.md` to reflect the current state of the project.
> 8. Append an entry to `design/changelog.md`.
