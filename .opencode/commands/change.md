description: Implement outstanding change requests
---

Read the following files:
- @design/prd-creator.md — your instructions and behavioral rules
- @design/prd.md — the current PRD
- @design/change-request.md — outstanding change requests to implement

Check `design/references/` for any supporting context referenced in the change requests.
Check `design/assets/` for any app files that need to be integrated into the project (keep originals in place).

Implement the outstanding change requests. For each one:
1. Ask clarifying questions if anything is ambiguous
2. Integrate any files from `design/assets/` into the appropriate destination
3. Implement the code changes in `src/`
4. Update `design/prd.md` to reflect the new state
5. Move the request from **Outstanding** to **Finalized** in `design/change-request.md`
6. Log what you did in `design/changelog.md`
