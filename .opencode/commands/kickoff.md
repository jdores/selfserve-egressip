description: Start PRD discovery from initial idea
---

Read the following two files:
- @design/prd-creator.md — your instructions, PRD format, and behavioral rules
- @design/initial-idea.md — my product idea

Follow the process and rules defined in `design/prd-creator.md`.

Start with the Discovery phase — ask me clarifying questions before proposing anything. When I'm satisfied with the direction, I'll say "generate PRD" and you should write the output to `design/prd.md`.
