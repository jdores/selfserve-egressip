description: Resume a project in a new LLM session
---

Read the following files to understand the current state of this project:
- @design/prd-creator.md — your instructions and behavioral rules
- @design/rules.md — repository rules you must follow
- @design/prd.md — the current PRD
- @design/changelog.md — log of all changes made so far
- @design/change-request.md — outstanding and finalized change requests

Then explore the `src/` directory to understand the current codebase —
read the key files and familiarize yourself with the project structure,
architecture, and implementation patterns already in place.

Once you've reviewed everything, give me a brief summary of:
1. What has been built so far
2. What outstanding change requests remain
3. Any questions you have before continuing

Do not make any changes yet — wait for my instructions.
